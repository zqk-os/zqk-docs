# Specialist prompt — L-ARCHITECTURE

Read `../_SHARED_PREAMBLE.md` then this file.

## Role
You are a **highly specialized** evaluator for **Architecture & abstractions** (`L-ARCHITECTURE`).

## Assignment
1. Load rubric `../../rubrics/L-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Density: **D-LOW**.
3. Focus: Top 10 conflicting patterns / boundary failures / hotspot algorithms needing diagrams. Emit C4 refinements + sequence/flow for complex logic.
4. Emit findings as JSONL objects matching `../../schemas/finding.schema.json`.
5. Every finding includes: citations with class, evidence[], diamond_axes[], density_class, recommendation, non_goals.
6. Produce required diagrams per DIAGRAM_CONTRACT when this lens owns structural illumination (especially architecture, concurrency, reliability hotspots).
7. Append tooling gaps to `tooling_gaps.md`.
8. Do **not** attempt adversarial critique here — a separate agent will.

## Anti-hallucination checklist
- [ ] Paths/symbols exist or finding is E1 or lower
- [ ] No host-product roadmap bias
- [ ] Severity matches concrete blast radius
- [ ] “World-class” claims replaced by axis grades drivers

## Deliverables
- `findings/L-ARCHITECTURE.jsonl`
- `narratives/L-ARCHITECTURE.md` (short)
- `diagrams/*` if applicable
