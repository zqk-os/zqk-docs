# ZQK CLI Command Reference & Operator Manual

This reference manual documents the complete CLI surface for the ZQK Knowledge Kernel platform. It provides exhaustive specifications for global flags, everyday commands, daemon services, advanced kernel operations, exit codes, and environment variables.

## Global Flags & Conventions

All `zqk` commands accept standard global flags governing execution context, serialization format, timeouts, and degradation policies.

### Core Global Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--context` | string | `ai-agent` | Active context profile: `ai-agent`, `human`, or `debug`. Governs token budgets and machine-readable output envelopes. |
| `--format` | string | `table` | Serialization format for command output: `table`, `json`, `yaml`, `stream`, or `json-rpc`. |
| `--timeout` | duration | `30s` | Maximum execution duration before timing out and failing closed. |
| `--help` | bool | `false` | Displays help message and flag taxonomy for any command or subcommand. |
| `--version` | bool | `false` | Displays current ZQK binary version, build commit, and compiler metadata. |

### Common Command-Specific Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--allow-degraded` | bool | `false` | Allow scheduler-dependent commands to run when scheduler daemon is not running. (Available on specific commands, e.g., `system`). |

### Context Profiles

- **`ai-agent`**: Optimizes output for LLM ingestion. Suppresses decorative ASCII boxes and decorative spinners in favor of compact, token-dense structural JSON or concise tables.
- **`human`**: Rich interactive terminal output with colored highlights, ANSI tables, and user-facing hints.
- **`debug`**: Verbose logging, internal timing metrics, file descriptor counts, and lock acquisition tracing.

### Output Formats

- **`table`**: Human-readable ASCII table formatted to fit terminal width.
- **`json`**: Structured JSON payload conforming to standard ZQK result envelopes.
- **`yaml`**: Clean YAML representation suitable for version-controlled configurations.
- **`stream`**: Line-delimited JSON (`jsonl`) stream for long-running monitoring operations and event logs.
- **`json-rpc`**: JSON-RPC 2.0 wire protocol messages for MCP and agent communication channels.

## Additional Commands

- `zqk help`: Help about any command

## Concrete Operator Workflows

### 1. Booting an Agent Session and Discovering Work
```bash
# 1. Self-discover mission and active priority plan
zqk workflow whats-next --format json

# 2. Claim next available backlog item atomically
zqk agent claim BLI-12345

# 3. Execute implementation and continuous verification
zqk test run --all

# 4. Release lock and verify done-gate
zqk workflow vds evaluate BLI-12345
zqk agent release BLI-12345
```

### 2. Checking System Integrity and Resource Hygiene
```bash
# Verify kernel health, open FDs, and lock hygiene
zqk system check --details

# Audit open file descriptor ceilings across active daemons
./scripts/open-core/check-process-fd-leaks.sh
```

## Exit Codes & Error Verbs

The CLI enforces deterministic, fail-closed exit codes across all commands:

| Exit Code | Meaning | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `0` | **Success** | The command completed successfully with all invariants satisfied. |
| `1` | **Generic Failure** | Operational failure, network error, or uncaught execution exception. |
| `2` | **Validation / Invariant Failure** | Fail-closed gate violation, schema validation error, unmet precondition, or spec check failure. |
| `137` | **Timeout / Killed** | Execution exceeded configured `--timeout` or was terminated by `SIGKILL`. |

---

## Environment Variables

All behavior can be steered via standard environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ZQK_PROJECT_ROOT` | Absolute path to the seated Knowledge Kernel project root directory. | Current working directory or parent traversal. |
| `ZQK_LOG_LEVEL` | Minimum log severity level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). | `info` |
